# Model Driven Engineering

Welcome to Model Driven Engineering: the open-source engineering book describing how modeling and simulation can be used to enhance a product design and operation - to deliver better value to the end-user.


## The mindset

We aim at redefining how engineering is taught by:
1. Sharing knowledge of multiple experts openly, to everyone - for a better reach.
2. Covering a complete engineering design, where the production operation is considered from the beginning and integrated in the requirement specification.
3. Implementing models using different tools and always providing a tool-agnostic manner to run the models - so that the book is not specific to a given toolchain.

Therefore, the book aims at being interactive and including executable models relying on different standards and tools.
Anyone is welcome to contribute to its development, either by opening a pull requests (or by reaching out to Dr. Clément Coïc directly).
